<h1>**Introduction**</h1>

The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in the field of data science and machine learning. It consists of 150 observations of Iris flowers, each classified into one of three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The dataset includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all measured in centimeters. Due to its simplicity and the clear distinction between the species, the Iris dataset is commonly used as a beginner's dataset for learning data analysis and machine learning techniques.

**Purpose**

The purpose of this project is to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to gain insights into the relationships between the different features and the species of the Iris flower. By analyzing the data, this project aims to:

Understand the distribution and central tendencies of the features within each species.
Standardize the dataset for consistency and ease of analysis.
Provide a foundation for further analysis, such as visualization or machine learning, to classify Iris species based on their measurements.
